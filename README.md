# PPC Trucking V1

This is a modified version of the popular "Trucking Gamemode" by [PowerPC603](http://forum.sa-mp.com/member.php?u=109984) for Grand Theft Auto [San Andreas Multiplayer](http://www.sa-mp.com) (SA:MP). You can find the original post on SA:MP forums here: http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=196493.

## Included
*	Complete gamemode as editable .pwn file
*	A ready-to-go server.cfg file (You only have to change the rcon_password!)
*	All required files for PAWNO so you can modify the gamemode as you like and re-compile it

## Installation
*	First go to the SA:MP website and [download the newest version](http://sa-mp.com/download.php) (both: server and client)
*	Follow [these instructions](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=106958) to set up your server
*	Then [get the latest stable release](https://github.com/PPC-Trucking/V1/releases/latest) of this repository (choose .zip or .tar.gz)
*	Unpack this archive into the directory where you have set up your server. Follow the structure of the folders. For example: Place files from the "gamemodes" folder **only** into the "gamemodes" folder. **Do not mix it up!**
*	([__*__](#licensing)) Download the following plugins and place them into the "plugins" folder. If the folder does not exist in the root directory (where you can find your "gamemodes" folder), create it. **Only there!**
	*	[sscanf](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=570927)
	*   [streamer](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=102865)
*   ([__*__](#licensing)) Get these files as well and put them into the _~/pawno/include_ folder.
	*   [sscanf2.inc](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=570927)
	*   [streamer.inc](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=102865)
	*   [zcmd.inc](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=91354)
	*   [dutils.inc](http://dracoblue.net/downloads/dutils/)
*	Now open _~/pawno/pawno.exe_ and load the gamemode to re-compile it
	* If everything worked, you should get a line saying ``Pawn compiler 3.2.3664 		Copyright (c) 1997-2006, ITB CompuPhase``
		* In this case, you can continue with the next point
		* If it did not work for you, please use Google first to solve the problem by yourself
			* If you could solve the problem, continue with the next point
			* If you could **not find** a solution for your problem, post the output in the [forum post](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=196493). Please do not send a private message to someone to ask for his or her help. If you post the problem with your output in forums **everyone** can benefit from the answers.
*	If everything worked for you, the last thing you have to do is this:
	*	As a Windows user, you only have to open the server.cfg file and to set your desired rcon_password
	*	If you are running your server on a Linux machine, open the server.cfg file and change ``plugins sscanf streamer`` to ``plugins sscanf.so streamer.so`` and make sure that you have placed these plugins into the folder. You also have to set your desired rcon_password.

### Thanks for reading!
*	By the way, if you already have experience with [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org), take a look at Slice's tutorial [how to use Notepad++ with PAWN](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=174046). Notepad++ makes it more comfortable to maintain your SA:MP gamemodes and filterscripts than the interal default editor.
